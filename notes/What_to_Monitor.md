**Grafana** and **Prometheus** for monitoring your **Spring Boot** application, several key metrics related to your application and its infrastructure will be tracked.

### **1. Application Metrics (Spring Boot)**

With the **Spring Boot Actuator** and **Micrometer** integration, **Prometheus** will scrape various metrics exposed by your application through the `/actuator/prometheus` endpoint. Here’s what will be monitored:

#### **a. HTTP Request Metrics:**
- **Requests per second**: The rate of incoming requests.
- **Response Time**: The time it takes to handle requests (e.g., average, percentiles).
- **Status Codes**: Counts of HTTP status codes (e.g., 2xx, 4xx, 5xx) for successful, client error, and server error responses.
- **Request Counts**: The total number of requests received by your application.

#### **b. JVM Metrics:**
- **Memory Usage**: Total heap memory used, free memory, and non-heap memory.
- **Garbage Collection**: Number of garbage collection events and their times (e.g., Young and Old Generation).
- **Thread Pool Usage**: Active threads, queued threads, and thread usage statistics.
- **JVM Uptime**: The amount of time your application has been running.

#### **c. Database Metrics:**
If you have configured **Spring Data JPA** (or any database interaction), you can monitor:
- **Database Query Count**: Number of SQL queries executed.
- **Query Execution Time**: Time taken for SQL queries.
- **Connection Pool Metrics**: Connection pool size and usage (e.g., how many connections are in use).

#### **d. Custom Metrics:**
You can define your own custom metrics to track application-specific behavior, such as:
- **Business Logic Metrics**: E.g., order creation count, failed login attempts, etc.
- **Cache Hits/Misses**: If your application uses caching (e.g., Redis), you can track cache performance.

### **2. Infrastructure Metrics**

In addition to your application-specific metrics, you can also monitor **system-level** metrics from the Kubernetes environment that your Spring Boot app is running in. These include:

#### **a. Pod Metrics:**
Prometheus scrapes various Kubernetes metrics related to the pods running your application:
- **Pod CPU Usage**: CPU usage per pod.
- **Pod Memory Usage**: Memory usage per pod.
- **Pod Restarts**: Number of restarts of your application’s pods.
- **Pod Availability**: Whether the pod is running or in a failed state.

#### **b. Node Metrics:**
Metrics for the nodes (VMs or physical machines) running your Kubernetes cluster:
- **CPU Usage**: CPU usage across nodes.
- **Memory Usage**: Memory usage across nodes.
- **Disk I/O**: Input/Output operations on disk.
- **Network I/O**: Data transferred over the network.

#### **c. Cluster-Wide Metrics:**
These monitor the overall health and performance of your Kubernetes cluster:
- **Node CPU/Memory Utilization**: Total CPU and memory utilization across the entire cluster.
- **Cluster Resource Usage**: Track the resource requests and limits for all pods and nodes in the cluster.
- **Scheduler and Controller Metrics**: Metrics related to the scheduling of workloads and the health of controllers managing your application deployments.

### **3. Visualizations in Grafana**

Once these metrics are collected by **Prometheus**, you can create dashboards in **Grafana** to visualize the data. Here’s what you can typically monitor in Grafana:

- **Application Health**: HTTP request status codes, uptime, and overall application health.
- **Resource Utilization**: Visualize CPU and memory usage for your pods, nodes, and even specific containers.
- **Database Performance**: Database connection pool usage, query execution time, and SQL query counts.
- **Request Latency**: Average response time and request latency over time.
- **Error Rates**: Number of 4xx and 5xx errors, helping you identify potential issues with your application.

### **Common Dashboards to Use in Grafana**

Grafana has pre-built dashboards specifically designed for monitoring **Spring Boot** applications with **Prometheus**. Some of the most common dashboards include:

1. **Spring Boot Actuator Metrics Dashboard**:
   - Monitors common Spring Boot metrics (e.g., requests, responses, and JVM health).
2. **Kubernetes Cluster Metrics Dashboard**:
   - Monitors cluster-wide metrics (e.g., pod, node, and service health).
3. **Prometheus Overview Dashboard**:
   - Provides an overview of Prometheus scraping behavior and targets.

### **Example Metrics You Will See in Grafana**

- **HTTP Request Count and Latency**: 
  - Metrics like `http_server_requests_seconds_count` (request count) and `http_server_requests_seconds_sum` (latency) will allow you to monitor the number of requests, the request rate, and the average latency.
  
- **JVM Memory Usage**: 
  - Metrics such as `jvm_memory_bytes_used` show the memory consumption of your application.
  
- **Garbage Collection**: 
  - Metrics like `jvm_gc_pause_seconds_count` (number of GC pauses) will help you identify memory management issues.

- **Pod and Node Metrics**: 
  - Metrics like `kube_pod_container_resource_requests_cpu_cores` show CPU resource requests for pods, and `kube_pod_container_resource_requests_memory_bytes` shows memory resource requests.

- **Error Rates**: 
  - Metrics such as `http_server_requests_seconds_count{status="500"}` allow you to track server errors.

### **Conclusion**

By combining **Prometheus** and **Grafana**, you'll be able to monitor a comprehensive set of metrics from your Spring Boot application, as well as the underlying infrastructure (Kubernetes and hardware resources). This gives you valuable insights into:
- **Performance**: How efficiently your app and infrastructure are running.
- **Health**: Detecting failures, crashes, or resource exhaustion.
- **Capacity**: Scaling the application or infrastructure based on usage trends.

You can create custom dashboards and alerts based on these metrics to proactively manage your Spring Boot application.
